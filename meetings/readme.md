# O3DE Operations SIG - Meetings

## Meetings

Each SIG hosts a regular community meeting to update the community about the progress of the project and the SIG's contribution to the project. It is a recurring event to give everyone a chance to have their voice heard. The SIG holds its meetings each week at 2100 UTC, and future meetings are held based on the [agendas on GitHub](https://github.com/o3de/sig-operations/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Asig%2Fbuild+label%3Amtg-agenda+).

Please [reach out on Discord](https://discord.gg/79NRgDuhT4) or [Sign up on the Mailing Lists](https://lists.o3de.org/groups) to get notifications for the recurring events.

## Who can Attend

O3DE cannot work without the help and input from as many of its community members as possible. *You do not need anyone’s permission to get involved and contribute to the project.* The #sig-operations channel on [O3DE Discord](https://discord.gg/FbbjuFrEB5) is a great place to begin getting involved. Many of our community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the [GitHub Discussions area](https://github.com/o3de/sig-operations/discussions) which need your input.

## Agenda Items

You can find a link to the proposed agenda for the next call in the table below. The agenda for each meeting is saved as [an issue on Github](https://github.com/o3de/sig-operations/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Asig%2Fbuild+label%3Amtg-agenda+) under the O3DE [Foundation repository](https://github.com/o3de/sig-operations).

Please feel free to propose any of your topics, thoughts, or areas you feel are important to discuss.
